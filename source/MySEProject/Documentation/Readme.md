Project Title :- Implementation of KNN Classifier 
# KNN Classifier
-KNN (The k-nearest neighbors algorithm) is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
-It's a type of instance-based learning where the algorithm makes predictions based on the majority class of the k-nearest neighbors of a given data point.
- A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is a type of instance-based learning algorithm used for classification tasks. 
- It classifies a data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space. 
- The distance metric (usually Euclidean distance) is used to measure the similarity between data points.

# Class KNN_CQ.cs
Added a new class named KNN_CQ.cs for KNN Classifier modification, the class has different methods and a brief overview of the methods is given below:
